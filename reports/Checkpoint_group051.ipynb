    "Our project aims to take in an image of a chess board and output where every piece lies on the board. To do so, we will use the [`koryakinp/chess-positions`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koryakinp/chess-positions) Kaggle dataset made up of 100,000 images of Chess boards in various styles along with the true positions of every piece. Our project will then compare multiple machine learning models learned in class (SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.) to determine the best model by percentage of board correctly identified.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chess is one of the most popular games of the 21st century, with millions of people around the world competing to see who can checkmate their opponent. The advent of AI Chess bots allowed people to quickly analyze their games against top-level players to see exactly where they went wrong and improve their play at a rate unseen in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limiting factor, however, was that players needed to represent their games digitally for the first time. This can take a lot of work, especially considering how fast the game can progress across several moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where our project comes in. We hope to produce a model that can take in a simple image of a Chess board and output a standardized format that anyone can plug into their favorite Chess trainer of choice. We expect this to rapidly improve the rate at which people can learn, thus forwarding the game of Chess as a whole."

    "- The name of the image is the board state in Forsyth-Eswards (FEN) format. You can read more about that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation).\n",
    "  - Our model uses a FEN parser to clean this format into a sparser 8x8 matrix with each cell representing the piece.\n",
    "- Each image is 400x400 pixels, each with a RGB value. resulting in 64,000,000 x 3 = 192,000,000 total observations per data point.\n",
    "  - Our models will be concerned with individual pieces. Taking this into account subdivides the image into an 8x8 grid, with each piece representing a 50x50 slice of the image.\n",
    "    - This results in 2,500 x 3 = 7,500 variables\n",
    "    - We grayscaling each subplot (back to 2,500 variables), since the essence of the feature is still represented quite well.\n",
